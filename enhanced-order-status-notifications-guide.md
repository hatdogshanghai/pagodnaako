# Enhanced Order Status Notifications Guide

This guide explains the enhanced order status notification system that shows detailed updates from the admin to customers, including messages like "Your order is preparing" and other status updates.

The enhanced notification system provides customers with real-time updates about their order status changes. When an admin updates an order status in the admin dashboard, the customer receives:

1. A toast notification with a status-specific icon and color
2. A notification in the notification bell dropdown
3. A sound alert
4. A desktop notification (if permission is granted)

The system supports the following order status types, each with a unique message and visual style:

| Status | Message | Icon | Color |
|--------|---------|------|-------|
| Pending | Your order is pending confirmation | bell | purple |
| Processing | Your order is now being processed | loader | yellow |
| Accepted | Your order has been accepted and is being processed | check | green |
| Preparing | Your order is now being prepared by our kitchen | dish | orange |
| Ready for Pickup | Your order is ready for pickup! | check-circle | green |
| Out for Delivery | Your order is out for delivery and will arrive soon! | car | blue |
| Shipped | Your order has been shipped and is on its way to you! | package | blue |
| Delivered | Your order has been delivered. Enjoy! | check-double | green |
| Completed | Your order has been completed. Thank you for your business! | check-circle | green |
| Rejected | Your order has been rejected | x-circle | red |
| Cancelled | Your order has been cancelled | x-circle | red |
