   cd C:\Users\PC 01\OneDrive\Desktop\TasteMakers\pagodnaako
   ```
3. Run the push command:

   ```
4. When prompted, enter your GitHub credentials:

## Method 2: Using the Simple Push Script

   ```
2. Double-click on the `simple-push.bat` file

## Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

If you're having trouble with authentication, you might need to create a personal access token:

1. Go to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give it a name like "TasteMakers Project"
4. Select the "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (you won't be able to see it again)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing to GitHub

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues, try these steps:

1. Make sure you're using the correct GitHub username and password/token
2. Check if you have Git configured with your GitHub email:
   ```
   git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
3. Try using HTTPS instead of SSH:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/hatdogshanghai/pagodnaako.git
   ```
4. Check if you have permission to push to the repository
5. Try pushing with the verbose flag to see more details:
   ```
   git push -v origin main
   ```

If all else fails, you can manually upload your files through the GitHub website:

1. Go to https://github.com/hatdogshanghai/pagodnaako
2. Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop your files or click to select them
4. Click "Commit changes"

Note: This method is limited to 100 files at a time, so you may need to do it in batches.
