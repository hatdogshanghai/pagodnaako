# Enhanced Order Notification System

This document explains the enhanced notification system that alerts customers when admins update the status of their ordered products.

## Features

1. **Real-time Notifications**: Customers receive instant notifications when an admin updates their order status
2. **Visual Indicators**: 
   - Notification bell icon with unread count
   - Bell animation when new notifications arrive
   - Highlighted notification items for unread notifications
3. **Audio Alerts**: Sound notification plays when a new notification is received
4. **Desktop Notifications**: Browser notifications appear even when the tab is not active
5. **Order Navigation**: Clicking on a notification navigates to the relevant order in the profile page

## How It Works

### For Customers

When an admin updates the status of an order:

1. A notification is created in the customer's notification list
2. The notification bell shows a red badge with the number of unread notifications
3. The bell icon animates to draw attention
4. A sound plays to alert the customer
5. A desktop notification appears (if permission is granted)
6. Clicking the notification navigates to the order in the profile page

### For Admins

When updating an order status in the admin dashboard:

1. The system automatically creates a notification for the customer
2. The notification includes details about the status change
3. Different notification types are created based on the status (Accepted, Rejected, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled)

## Technical Implementation

### Files

1. **global-notifications.js**: Handles notification display, animations, and interactions
2. **notification-sound.js**: Contains the base64-encoded notification sound
3. **admin-dashboard.js**: Contains the `createNotificationForUser` function that creates notifications when order status changes

### Key Functions

1. **createNotificationForUser**: Creates a notification when an admin updates an order status
2. **loadUserNotifications**: Loads and displays notifications for a user
3. **showDesktopNotification**: Shows a browser notification
4. **animateNotificationBell**: Animates the notification bell when new notifications arrive
5. **playNotificationSound**: Plays a sound when new notifications arrive
6. **markNotificationAsRead**: Marks a notification as read when clicked
7. **markAllNotificationsAsRead**: Marks all notifications as read

## Notification Types

The system supports the following notification types:

1. **Order Accepted**: When an admin accepts an order
2. **Order Rejected**: When an admin rejects an order
3. **Order Shipped**: When an order is marked as shipped
4. **Order Delivered**: When an order is marked as delivered
5. **Order Cancelled**: When an order is cancelled

## User Experience

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Customers know immediately when their order status changes
2. **Clear Information**: Notifications clearly indicate what changed and when
3. **Easy Navigation**: One click takes customers to the relevant order
4. **Persistent Notifications**: Notifications remain until marked as read
5. **Bulk Management**: "Mark all as read" button for easy notification management

## Browser Support

The notification system works in all modern browsers. Desktop notifications require:

1. A browser that supports the Notification API
2. User permission to show notifications
3. The website to be served over HTTPS (for production)

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the notification system:

1. Push notifications for mobile devices
2. Email notifications for important status changes
3. Notification preferences to allow users to choose which notifications they receive
4. Notification grouping for multiple updates to the same order
5. Notification expiration to automatically remove old notifications
