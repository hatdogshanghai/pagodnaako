# Order Selection Feature

This document explains the new order selection feature that allows users to easily select and remove multiple orders from their order history.

## Overview

The order selection feature provides a convenient way for users to manage their order history by allowing them to:

1. Select individual orders using checkboxes
2. Select all orders at once with a "Select All" checkbox
3. Remove multiple selected orders with a single click

## How to Use

### Selecting Orders

1. **Individual Selection**: Each order in the order history now has a checkbox on the left side. Click the checkbox to select an order.
2. **Select All**: Use the "Select All" checkbox at the top of the order history to select all orders at once.
3. **Deselect All**: Uncheck the "Select All" checkbox to deselect all orders.

### Removing Selected Orders

1. Once you have selected one or more orders, the "Remove Selected" button will become active.
2. Click the "Remove Selected" button to remove all selected orders from your history.
3. A confirmation dialog will appear asking you to confirm the removal.
4. After confirmation, the selected orders will be removed from your order history.

## Visual Indicators

- Selected orders are highlighted with a blue background and border
- The number of selected orders is displayed next to the "Remove Selected" button
- The "Remove Selected" button is disabled when no orders are selected

## Technical Details

### Implementation

The selection feature works with both Firebase-stored orders and locally stored orders:

- For Firebase orders: The orders are marked as "hidden" in the database
- For local orders: The orders are completely removed from localStorage

### Data Structure

The selection system tracks orders with the following information:

```javascript
{
  id: "orderId",
  isLocal: true/false  // Whether the order is stored locally or in Firebase
}
```

### Persistence

- Order selection is not persisted between page refreshes
- When the page is refreshed, all selections are cleared

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the order selection feature:

1. **Selections not working**: Try refreshing the page and selecting again
2. **Orders not being removed**: Check your internet connection, as Firebase orders require connectivity to be removed
3. **Visual glitches**: If the highlighting doesn't appear correctly, try refreshing the page

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the order selection feature:

1. Batch operations for other actions (e.g., cancel multiple orders)
2. Filter and select orders by status
3. Select orders by date range
4. Export selected orders as CSV or PDF
