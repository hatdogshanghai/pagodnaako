# Order Status Notification System

This document explains the enhanced order status notification system that alerts customers when admins update the status of their ordered products.

## Features

1. **Real-time Order Status Updates**: Customers receive instant notifications when an admin updates their order status
2. **Toast Notifications**: Pop-up notifications appear on the screen when an order status changes
3. **Notification Bell**: The notification bell in the header shows unread notifications
4. **Sound Alerts**: Audio notification plays when an order status changes
5. **Desktop Notifications**: Browser notifications appear even when the tab is not active

## How It Works

### For Customers

When an admin updates the status of an order:

1. A toast notification appears in the top-right corner of the screen
2. The notification bell shows a red badge with the number of unread notifications
3. The bell icon animates to draw attention
4. A sound plays to alert the customer
5. A desktop notification appears (if permission is granted)
6. The notification is added to the notification dropdown

### For Admins

When updating an order status in the admin dashboard:

1. The system automatically creates a notification for the customer
2. The notification includes details about the status change
3. Different notification types are created based on the status (Accepted, Rejected, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled)

## Technical Implementation

### Files

1. **order-status-notifications.js**: Handles order status notifications specifically
2. **global-notifications.js**: Handles general notification display and interactions
3. **notification-sound.js**: Contains the base64-encoded notification sound
4. **admin-dashboard.js**: Contains the code that creates notifications when order status changes

### Key Functions

1. **listenForOrderStatusUpdates**: Listens for changes to order status in real-time
2. **createOrderStatusNotification**: Creates a notification when an order status changes
3. **showOrderStatusToast**: Shows a toast notification for order status updates
4. **initOrderStatusNotifications**: Initializes the order status notification system

## Notification Types

The system supports the following order status notification types:

1. **Pending**: When an order is first placed
2. **Accepted**: When an admin accepts an order
3. **Rejected**: When an admin rejects an order
4. **Shipped**: When an order is marked as shipped
5. **Delivered**: When an order is marked as delivered
6. **Cancelled**: When an order is cancelled

## User Experience

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Customers know immediately when their order status changes
2. **Multiple Notification Channels**: Toast notifications, notification bell, and desktop notifications
3. **Clear Information**: Notifications clearly indicate what changed and when
4. **Easy Navigation**: Clicking on a notification navigates to the relevant order
5. **Persistent Notifications**: Notifications remain until marked as read

## Toast Notifications

Toast notifications provide immediate feedback about order status changes:

1. **Appearance**: Slides in from the right side of the screen
2. **Duration**: Automatically disappears after 5 seconds
3. **Interaction**: Can be manually dismissed by clicking the close button
4. **Content**: Shows the order status and a brief message

## Browser Support

The notification system works in all modern browsers. Desktop notifications require:

1. A browser that supports the Notification API
2. User permission to show notifications
3. The website to be served over HTTPS (for production)

## How to Test

To test the order status notification system:

1. Log in as a customer
2. Place an order
3. Log in as an admin in another browser or incognito window
4. Update the order status in the admin dashboard
5. Observe the notifications appearing for the customer

## Troubleshooting

If notifications are not appearing:

1. Make sure the user is logged in
2. Check the browser console for errors
3. Verify that Firebase is properly initialized
4. Check that permission for desktop notifications is granted
5. Verify that the order status was actually updated in the database

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the order status notification system:

1. Customizable notification preferences
2. Email notifications for important status changes
3. SMS notifications for critical updates
4. Notification history page
5. More detailed information in notifications
